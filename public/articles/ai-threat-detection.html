            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing cybersecurity by enabling systems to detect, analyze, and respond to threats faster and more accurately than traditional methods. As cyber threats become increasingly sophisticated and voluminous, conventional signature-based detection systems struggle to keep pace. AI and ML offer a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive security, learning from patterns, adapting to new threats, and automating response mechanisms. This article explores how these technologies are transforming the landscape of cybersecurity and threat detection.</p>

            <h2>How AI Enhances Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Anomaly Detection:</strong> AI systems establish baselines of normal network behavior and flag deviations that could indicate security threats. Unlike traditional systems that rely on known threat signatures, AI can detect novel attack patterns and zero-day exploits by identifying unusual activities.</p>
            <p>For example, if a user account suddenly accesses large amounts of sensitive data at unusual hours, AI algorithms can flag this as suspicious even if it doesn't match any known attack signature.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Behavioral Analysis:</strong> Machine learning models analyze user and entity behavior to detect insider threats, compromised accounts, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). By understanding normal user patterns—such as login times, accessed resources, and typical actions—AI can identify when an account behaves abnormally.</p>
            <p>User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) platforms use ML to create dynamic behavioral profiles and detect subtle anomalies that might escape rule-based systems.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Predictive Intelligence:</strong> AI analyzes historical data, threat intelligence feeds, and emerging patterns to predict potential future attacks. This predictive capability allows security teams to strengthen defenses proactively rather than responding after an incident occurs.</p>
            <p>Predictive models can forecast which systems are most likely to be targeted, what types of attacks are trending, and when attacks are most likely to occur.</p>

            <p><strong>4. Automated Response:</strong> AI-powered security systems can automatically respond to detected threats in real-time, isolating affected systems, blocking malicious traffic, or triggering incident response workflows without human intervention.</p>
            <p>This automation significantly reduces response times from hours or days to milliseconds, potentially preventing or minimizing damage from attacks.</p>

            <p><strong>5. Malware Classification:</strong> Machine learning excels at identifying and categorizing malware, including variants and polymorphic malware that constantly change to evade detection. ML models analyze code behavior, file characteristics, and execution patterns to classify threats accurately.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning Algorithms in Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> These algorithms learn from labeled datasets containing examples of both legitimate and malicious activities. Common applications include:</p>

                <li>Algorithms: K-means clustering, DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, Autoencoders</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> Neural networks with multiple layers can learn complex patterns and representations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Image-based malware detection (analyzing executable visualization)</li>
                <li>Natural language processing for threat intelligence analysis</li>
                <li>Advanced pattern recognition in network traffic</li>
                <li>Architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> These algorithms learn optimal actions through trial and error, useful for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adaptive firewall rule optimization</li>
                <li>Automated penetration testing</li>
